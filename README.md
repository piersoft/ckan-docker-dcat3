# Docker Compose setup for CKAN


* [Overview](#overview)
* [Installing Docker](#installing-docker)
* [docker compose vs docker-compose](#docker-compose-vs-docker-compose)
* [Install CKAN plus dependencies](#install-ckan-plus-dependencies)



## 1.  Overview

This is a set of configuration and setup files to run a CKAN site.

The CKAN images used are from the official CKAN [ckan-docker](https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker-base) repo

The non-CKAN images are as follows:

* PostgreSQL: Official PostgreSQL image. Database files are stored in a named volume.
* Solr: CKAN's [pre-configured Solr image](https://github.com/ckan/ckan-solr). Index data is stored in a named volume.
* Redis: standard Redis image
* NGINX: latest stable nginx image that includes SSL and Non-SSL endpoints

The site is configured using environment variables that you can set in the `.env` file.

## 2.  Installing Docker

Install Docker by following the following instructions: [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

To verify a successful Docker installation, run `docker run hello-world` and `docker version`. These commands should output 
versions for client and server.

## 3.  docker compose *vs* docker-compose

All Docker Compose commands in this README will use the V2 version of Compose ie: `docker compose`. The older version (V1) 
used the `docker-compose` command. Please see [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-v2/) for
more information.

## 4.  Install (build and run) CKAN plus dependencies

#### Base mode

Use this if you are a maintainer and will not be making code changes to CKAN or to CKAN extensions

Copy the included `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`. Modify it depending on your own needs.

ATTENTION!!! substitute every www.piersoftckan.biz in .env file (in example https://192.168.0.67:8443) and in each files into ckan/docker-entrypoint.d/ dir. Change in .env ckan_admin password..

Please note that when accessing CKAN directly (via a browser) ie: not going through NGINX you will need to make sure you have "ckan" set up
to be an alias to localhost in the local hosts file. Either that or you will need to change the `.env` entry for CKAN_SITE_URL

Using the default values on the `.env.example` file will get you a working CKAN instance. There is a sysadmin user created by default with the values defined in `CKAN_SYSADMIN_NAME` and `CKAN_SYSADMIN_PASSWORD`(`ckan_admin` and `test1234` by default). This should be obviously changed before running this setup as a public CKAN instance.


## First step: 

	git clone https://github.com/piersoft/ckan-docker-dcat3.git

To build the images (remember before to rename and configure .env.example file) :

	docker compose build

To start the containers:

	docker compose up -d



This will start up the containers in the current window. By default the containers will log direct to this window with each container
using a different colour. 

At the end of the container start sequence there should be 6 containers running

After this step, CKAN should be running at `CKAN_SITE_URL`. (example https://192.168.0.67:8443 instead https://www.piersoftckan.biz)
